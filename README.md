AnnotationDispatch
===================
Implementation of multiple dispatch in Java using annotation processing mechanisms.

###Requirements:
 - Java8
 - Maven

###Demo:
*./demo.bash* script will compile both dependencies (Annotation and Processor) and use them during compilation of the Demo project.

###Debugging the annotation processor:
 - run debug.bash script (builds the processor and annotation and starts compiling the Demo project)
 - connect to port 8000 with the debugger (for example, with IntelliJ IDEA use "remote" run configuration)
